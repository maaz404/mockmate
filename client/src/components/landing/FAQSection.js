      question: "What technologies power the MockMate platform?",
      answer:
        "MockMate is built using a modern full-stack architecture: React 18.2.0 with hooks for the frontend, Node.js with Express.js for the backend, MongoDB as the database, Google OAuth with server-managed sessions for authentication, and Tailwind CSS for responsive styling. The platform also integrates with AI APIs for natural language processing and feedback generation.",
    },
    {
      question: "How does the AI feedback system work technically?",
      answer:
        "The AI system processes user responses through natural language processing APIs, analyzing semantic content, coherence, and technical accuracy. The backend implements asynchronous processing with Node.js streams to handle real-time analysis, storing results in MongoDB and returning structured feedback through RESTful endpoints.",
    },
    {
      question: "What database design patterns are implemented?",
      answer:
        "The system uses MongoDB with Mongoose ODM for schema validation and data modeling. Key patterns include document embedding for related data, aggregation pipelines for analytics, proper indexing for query optimization, and data normalization where appropriate to maintain referential integrity.",
    },
    {
      question: "How is user authentication and security handled?",
      answer:
        "Authentication is managed via Google Sign-In (OAuth 2.0) with secure server-side sessions stored in MongoDB. The backend implements security middleware, input validation, and error handling to protect API routes and user data.",
    },
    {
      question: "What development methodologies were followed?",
      answer:
        "The project follows modern software development practices including component-based architecture, RESTful API design, responsive web design principles, version control with Git, modular code organization, and comprehensive error handling throughout the application stack.",
    },
    {
      question: "How does the real-time processing work?",
      answer:
        "Real-time features are implemented using Node.js event-driven architecture with asynchronous processing. The system handles concurrent user sessions through non-blocking I/O operations, maintains state consistency, and provides immediate feedback through optimized API response times.",
    },
    {
      question: "What are the system's scalability considerations?",
      answer:
        "The architecture is designed for scalability with stateless backend services, database indexing for performance, component reusability in the frontend, efficient API design, and modular code structure that allows for easy feature expansion and maintenance.",
    },
    {
      question: "How is data visualization implemented?",
      answer:
        "The dashboard uses Chart.js integration with React components to visualize user performance metrics. Data is processed through MongoDB aggregation pipelines and served via API endpoints, with responsive charts that adapt to different screen sizes and provide interactive user analytics.",
    },
    {
      question: "What were the main technical challenges?",
      answer:
        "Key challenges included implementing real-time AI processing, managing asynchronous data flows, creating responsive UI components, integrating multiple APIs efficiently, designing scalable database schemas, and ensuring consistent user experience across different devices and browsers.",
    },
    {
      question: "How can the project be extended or improved?",
      answer:
        "Future enhancements could include implementing WebSocket connections for real-time updates, adding microservices architecture, incorporating machine learning models, expanding API functionality, adding comprehensive testing suites, and implementing DevOps practices for automated deployment.",
    },
